Write a function that takes an integer n and return all possible combinations
of its factors (other than 1 and itself).

Numbers can be regarded as product of its factors. For example,
8 = 2 x 2 x 2;
  = 2 x 4.

Examples:
input: 1
output:
[]


input: 37
output:
[]

input: 32
output:
[
  [2, 16],
  [2, 2, 8],
  [2, 2, 2, 4],
  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2],
